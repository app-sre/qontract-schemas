description: |
  Schema for defining a self-service scorecard for limited-scope service engagements.
  The scorecard helps service owners assess their maturity and reliability
  based on well-defined acceptance criteria established by AppSRE for
  production services. Each scorecard is a self-assessment, to be filled
  in and maintained by service owners, and is intended to be visible to
  all stakeholders. The scorecard enables AppSRE to raise awareness and
  provide recommendations for improving service maturity.
