description: |
  Schema for documenting Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for an application or
  component. This schema enables teams to transparently define, track, and
  communicate SLOs, including SLI definitions, targets, time windows, and
  justifications. SLO documents help drive reliability, set user expectations,
  and support automated alerting and reporting.
