title: "SRE Checkpoint"
description: |
  Schema for documenting an SRE checkpoint for a service. SRE checkpoints are
  periodic reviews performed by AppSRE to assess service reliability, adherence
  to best practices, and operational readiness. The process includes verifying
  metadata, SLOs, SOPs, and reliability, and tracking improvements via JIRA.
  This schema enables traceability of checkpoint events, responsible engineers,
  and contract versions.
