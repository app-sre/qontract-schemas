        One per saas file Template name. It is very limited in size as the tekton
        pipeline final name will also contain the saas file and the max size of
        a pipeline is limited to 63 characters.

        But we impose another restriction, because pipeline retries generate a
        pipeline run that appends 7 characters to the pipeline name. Since pipeline
        runs also have a 63 character limit, this limits pipeline names to 56
        characters, which finally limits the pipeline names to 15. See all the
        details in the openshift-tekton-resources integration.
