title: "Tekton Pipeline Template"
description: |
  Schema for defining a Tekton pipeline template. Tekton pipeline templates
  are reusable definitions for CI/CD pipelines that can be deployed in
  Tekton pipeline provider namespaces. This schema allows specifying the
  template's name, type, file path, and variables for parameterization.
  It supports both per-SaaS file and per-namespace pipeline templates,
  with naming constraints to ensure compatibility with Tekton object limits.

      The unique name of the Tekton pipeline template. Naming constraints
      apply based on the template type to ensure compatibility with Tekton

      The type of pipeline template. Use 'onePerSaasFile' for templates
      that are unique per SaaS file, or 'onePerNamespace' for templates
      that are unique per namespace.

      The file path to the pipeline template definition.

  variables:

    description: |
      A mapping of variable names to values for parameterizing the pipeline
      template. Variables can be used to customize pipeline behavior for
      different deployments.

        One per saas file Template name. It is very limited in size as the tekton
        pipeline final name will also contain the saas file and the max size of
        a pipeline is limited to 63 characters.

        But we impose another restriction, because pipeline retries generate a
        pipeline run that appends 7 characters to the pipeline name. Since pipeline
        runs also have a 63 character limit, this limits pipeline names to 56
        characters, which finally limits the pipeline names to 15. See all the
        details in the openshift-tekton-resources integration.
