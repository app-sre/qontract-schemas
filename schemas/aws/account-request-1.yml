title: "Account Request"
description: |
  Schema for requesting the creation of a new AWS account. This schema captures
  all required information for AppSRE to automate AWS account creation, including
  account name, owner, organization, quota limits, and additional features.
  Account requests are processed by integrations to provision accounts, assign
  organizational units, set tags, and configure initial quotas. This enables
  GitOps-driven, auditable, and self-service AWS account management.
  After successful account creation, automation deletes the
  `account-request-1.yml` file and adds `account-1.yml` file.
