  Schema for defining a DNS record in a Cloudflare-managed zone.
  This schema supports all standard DNS record types, including
  A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, NS, MX, CAA, DS, and DNSKEY. It enables
  declarative management of DNS records, including advanced DNSSEC
  and proxying options, for automation and compliance in
  app-interface-managed Cloudflare zones.
