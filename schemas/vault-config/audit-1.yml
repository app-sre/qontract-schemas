  Schema for configuring a Vault audit device. Vault audit devices record
  all requests and responses to Vault, providing a detailed audit trail for
  security and compliance. This schema supports configuration of file, syslog,
  and socket audit backends, allowing teams to specify device type, options,
  and integration with Vault instances. Use this schema to ensure all Vault
  operations are logged according to organizational and regulatory requirements.
