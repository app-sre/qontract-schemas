description: |
  Schema for defining a Vault policy. Vault policies specify access control
  rules for secrets, paths, and operations within a Vault instance. This
  schema enables teams to manage policies declaratively, associating them
  with specific Vault instances and providing fine-grained permissions for
  users, applications, and integrations. Policies are written in HCL and
  control what actions are allowed or denied within Vault.
