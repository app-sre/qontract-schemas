title: "Replication Paths"
description: |
  Schema for defining replication paths for Vault replication. Replication
  paths specify which secrets or data should be synchronized between Vault
  instances, and how access is managed for each path. This schema supports
  integration with Jenkins instances and Vault policies, enabling fine-grained
  control over which secrets are replicated and under what conditions.
