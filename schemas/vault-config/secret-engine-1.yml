  Schema for defining a Vault secret engine. Secret engines are components
  in Vault that store, generate, or encrypt data, such as key-value (kv)
  stores or TOTP generators. This schema allows configuring the mount path,
  engine type, Vault instance, and backend-specific options. Use this schema
  to declaratively manage secret engines across multiple Vault clusters.
